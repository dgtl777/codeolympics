        <p class="p1"> There were many people now on the server, whom were all good friends. Some loved eachothers' company while others hated it. They formed into groups the first being a team, the Dream Team, comprised of Dream, GeorgeNotFound, Sapnap, BadBoyHalo, AntFrost, Awesamdude and Punz. To oppose them, stood L'Manberg comprised of WilburSoot, Tubbo, TommyInnit, Fundy and TheEret who was later outcasted. </p>
        <p class="p2"> L'Manberg growing too strong, the opposing forces had to stop them and such, the first war began the two tribes fighting for power while a lone stander, Technoblade, fights for the cause of no government. L'Manberg is suppressed which sparkes another enemy against the majority of the server, Manberg run by Jschlatt. Again Manberg is suppressed and L'Manberg rises once more. Dream again grew power but this time, his own allies against him, surrendered and gave into the Pandora's Vault, the prizon of the Dream SMP. Things were good then it happened. </p>
        <p class="p2"> The second war was upon them again, this time, the main forces both bow down to one almighty superpower which grew in the mountains far far away. Technoblade, accompanied by Philza rule the server and suppress all enemy forces. Like nomads killing everyone in their path. Hence Technoblade is put in prison. </p>
        <p class="p2"> Now with the two most powerful people on the server locked up in a virtually inescapable prison, the server is at rest... For now </p>
